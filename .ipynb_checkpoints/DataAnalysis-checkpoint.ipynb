    "We can look at the state of Alabama as an example before algorithmically analyzing all of the states. I used bayesian probability to derive how to calculate the rate of police homicide given race in a given state. The derivation of this (and thus all following formulas) is shown on my github using Bayes theoerem. Then using this probability and assuming a Poisson distribution(a probability distribution where something happens at a rate) I calculated the rate of homicide. This revealed significant racial disparities. Also if these numbers sound very large, it's important to remember these homicides include armed victims."
